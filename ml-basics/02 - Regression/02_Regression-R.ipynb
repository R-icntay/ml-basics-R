        "In this section, we'll explore another tidymodels package, [recipes](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/), which is designed to help you preprocess your data *before* training your model. A recipe is an object that defines a series of steps for data processing.\n",

        "#### Scaling numeric features\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalizing numeric features so they're on the same scale prevents features with large values from producing coefficients that disproportionately affect the predictions. For example, suppose your data includes the following numeric features:\n",
        "\n",
        "|  A  |  B  |  C  |\n",

        "| 0.3 | 0.48 | 0.65 |\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple ways you can scale numeric data, such as calculating the minimum and maximum values for each column and assigning a proportional value between 0 and 1, or by using the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed variable to maintain the same *spread* of values on a different scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Encoding categorical variables\n",
        "\n",
        "This involves translating a column with categorical values into one or more numeric columns that take the place of the original.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning models work best with numeric features rather than text values, so you generally need to convert categorical features into numeric representations. For example, suppose your data includes the following categorical feature.\n",

        "|  1   |\n",
        "|  2   |\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common technique is to create \"*dummy*\" or *indicator variables* which replace the original categorical feature with numeric columns whose values are either 1 or 0. This can be shown as:\n",
