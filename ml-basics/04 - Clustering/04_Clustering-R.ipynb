        "*`Clustering`* is a form of *`unsupervised`* machine learning in which observations are `grouped into clusters` based on `similarities` in their data values, or *features*. This kind of machine learning is considered unsupervised because it does not make use of previously known *label* values to train a model; in a clustering model, the label is the cluster to which the observation is assigned, based purely on its features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clustering works by separating the training cases based on similarities that can be determined from their feature values. Perhaps the two best-known clustering approaches are: `K-means clustering` and `hierarchical clustering`. In K-means clustering, we seek to partition the observations into a pre-specified number of clusters. On the other hand, in hierarchical clustering, we do not know in advance how many clusters we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way; the numeric features of a given entity can be thought of as vector coordinates that define the entity's position in n-dimensional space. What a clustering model seeks to do is to identify groups, or *clusters*, of entities that are close to one another while being separated from other clusters.\n",

The plot shows a large reduction in WCSS (so greater *tightness*) as the number of clusters increases from one to two, and a further noticable reduction from two to three clusters. After that, the reduction is less pronounced, resulting in an `elbow` ðŸ’ªin the chart at around three clusters. This is a good indication that there are two to three reasonably well separated clusters of data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "K-Means is a commonly used clustering algorithm that separates a dataset into *K* clusters of equal variance such that observations within the same cluster are as similar as possible (i.e., high intra-class similarity), whereas observations from different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (i.e., low inter-class similarity). The number of clusters, *K*, is user defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic algorithm has the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Specify the number of clusters to be created (this is done by the analyst). Taking the flowers example we used at the beginning of the lesson, this means deciding how many clusters you want to use to group the flowers.\n",
        "2.  Next, the algorithm randomly selects K observations from the data set to serve as the initial centers for the clusters (i.e., centroids).\n",
        "3.  Next, each of the remaining observations (in this case flowers) are assigned to its closest centroid.\n",
        "4.  Next, the new means of each cluster is computed and the centroid is moved to the mean.\n",
        "5.  Now that the centers have been recalculated, every observation is checked again to see if it might be closer to a different cluster. All the objects are reassigned again using the updated cluster means. The cluster assignment and centroid update steps are iteratively repeated until the cluster assignments stop changing (i.e., when convergence is achieved). Typically, the algorithm terminates when each new iteration results in negligible movement of centroids and the clusters become static.\n",
        "6.  Note that due to randomization of the initial k observations used as the starting centroids, we can get slightly different results each time we apply the procedure. For this reason, most algorithms use several *random starts* and choose the iteration with the lowest WCSS. As such, it is strongly recommended to always run K-Means with several values of *nstart* to avoid an *undesirable local optimum.*\n",
        "\n",
        "So training usually involves multiple iterations, reinitializing the centroids each time, and the model with the best (lowest) WCSS is selected. The following animation shows this process:\n",

After creating a series of clustering models with different numbers of clusters and plotting the WCSS across the clusters, we noticed a bend at around `k = 3`. This bend indicates that additional clusters beyond the third have little value and that there are two to three reasonably well separated clusters of data points.\n",

        "In this module, you learned how clustering can be used to create unsupervised machine learning models that group data observations into clusters. You then used the `Tidymodels` framework in R to perform dimension reduction using PCA and various packages in the R ecosystem such as `stats::kmeans()`, `stats::hclust()`, `cluster::agnes()` to train *K-Means* and *Hierarchical* clustering models.\n",
        "\n",
        "While `Tidymodels` (R) and `scikit-learn` (Python) are popular framework for writing code to train clustering models, you can also create machine learning solutions for clustering using the graphical tools in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. You can learn more about no-code development of clustering models using Azure Machine Learning in the [Create a clustering model with Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/) module.\n",
