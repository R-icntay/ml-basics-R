This flexibility comes with its downsides, but the big upside is how easy it is to evolve tailored grammars for specific parts of the data science process.

The professor could then take a sample of the data and analyze it to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of study a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. They might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade; or even prepare the data to train a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on their study habits.\n",
